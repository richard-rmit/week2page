                    I am 24 years old, born and raised in Australia. In high school I did not do too well as I was very rebellious, so I dropped out in year 10, when I turned 20, I discovered some basic scripts I found fun to work with and since then it has evolved into a full-blown obsession. As well as programming I play games, ride dirt bikes and play guitar.

            <h1>Interest In IT</h1>
            <p>
                My interest in IT is mainly to do with the backend side of things, I am not one for hands on with tech; I prefer code and the logic behind it all.
            </p>
            <p>
                I first started getting into code when I started writing scripts for a GTA 5 Mod called FiveM, I still work on it to this day on a server called FDG and we are currently the largest server in OCE. I code for this server alongside some people I consider my best friends now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I originally chose this course at RMIT because it fit my specifications, I may have knowledge with code, but I do not have the qualifications to go with it. So far, I am enjoying this course and it fits in well with my currently hectic life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main thing I wish to learn during my studies is how to work more efficiently with others, GitHub, jobs available.

            <!-- Appealing to Me -->
            <p> 
                This job would entail me creating new features and maintaining old features for programs and websites in a variety of languages, primarily C# and ASP.net which is also based in C#; This is of course my favourite language to work in so being able to earn a salary from being around people who also enjoy this would be the best for me.
            </p>

            <!-- Skills Required -->
            <p>
                The skills required for this position would be knowledge in backend programming, database management and understanding of Rest API's.
            </p>

            <!-- My Skills -->
            <p>
                I feel I have a large amount of the knowledge required from experience, but I don't have knowledge of the tools they use in the industry. I would also like to be 100% confident that I could handle myself in these positions. 
            </p>

            <!-- Plan -->
            <p>
                My plan is to work on my knowledge at university as well as build up the knowledge in work.

            <p>
                I think this result is pretty accurate about myself, working as a team it seems like it would make it more difficult because I tend to be quiet and not speak up much. I think I should be more confident when looking for a team to help the process.
            </p>

            <h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
            <img src="img/results-learning.png" id="learning-image">
            <p>
                Again I feel this is pretty accurate, when I am watching videos and listening to teachers I learn a lot better and quicker than when reading books. I think this helps with finding a group as I am more keen to get into a voice channel and chat.
            </p>

            <h3>Creativity Test</h3>
            <img src="img/results-creative.png" id="create-image">
            <p>
                Personaly I don't agree with some things that it is saying, it says my boldness isn't very high which I find very confusing as I am usually the one pushing for trying new things with programming. As for finding a group it seems being accepting of multiple theories at once and dealing with a large amount of information would be benificial.

        <div id="project-idea">
            <h1>Project Idea</h1>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                I had an idea with my mate who was an electrician to make an app that everyone who worked as an electrician could download and use to update & manage information about what was installed at address. 
                You would get a job at an address, open it up in the app and it would tell you for example what kind of fan or switches were installed at the address; this would allow the electrician to know what parts and tools to bring to the address and work out how much work was required.            
            </p>

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>
                This would be useful as a lot of time is wasted for electricians to come out and inspect properties for what needs replacing, updating, or re-worked; same goes for the type of internet connections they have at the house which would be useful for more than electricians.
    Being able to complete the work, put in the details and it update a database for that address so the next electrician who gets a job at the address can see what needs to be done would be super convenient and useful; especially considering how busy they can get and the demand.
            </p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                You would go to the website and register a new electrical company using an ABN to verify you are a legitimate company, once registered you have access to a page where you can add employees and adjust their access levels to edit certain information; this also would give them an access token to login on their app.<br><br>
    You would need to pay an annual service fee for using the service and this would cover the costs of running the project as well as paying developers.<br><br>
    Employees would be able to use their work phones to download the app and use it to update information on the fly at jobs; this could include updating product ids for appliances within the home or business as well as taking photos and uploading them.<br><br>
    They could also use the app for logging faults they have had at certain addresses as well as putting the correct details on how old the house / business is and/or how old the wiring is for the house / business.<br><br>
    Not only is this useful for the business but it also comes in handy when a customer calls up asking about getting a quote for replacing something within their house, for example: a customer calls up asking about repairing their ceiling fan, you can then look up their address, look at how old the ceiling fan is and whether you can get spare parts for it, or if you will have to replace the whole thing outright.<br><br>
    This speeds up the process for not only the customer but also the company, as not only has the process been refined for the person on the phone but it also means the that electrician knows exactly what they need to bring to the address instead of having to either run a van around full of equipment; or drive to the address, give the customer a quote and callout fee then see if they even want to use the quote to buy anything.<br><br>
    Another use is based off an experience from my friend, who went to an address to install a refrigerator for a family on their deck; when they turned off the circuit for that section they decided to check and found it was still live.<br><br> The section had been linked to the lighting which is dangerous and not up to code in Australia.<br><br> He could then go into address on the app and write down the details of the fault at the address informing any other electricians that they might try and come work on it that it in fact needs to be re-wired.<br><br> This is more for the safety side of things as well as saving the time of any other electricians they might try and get to come out.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                We would need to work in a environment where we could write for not only android but also iOS, also we would need multiple databases hosted around Australia to hold the information as well as backups for the information. 
            </p>

            <h3>Skills Required</h3>
            <p>
                The skills required for this project would be in the realm of programming knowledge, front end programming, cyber security as well as knowledge of setting up / managing databases. The tools and equipment would be very accessible to almost anybody.
            </p>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                I feel this project would be very beneficial for a lot of people but would need support behind it from companies to allow it to work, without the companies faith and support in the project it would be sure to fail.
